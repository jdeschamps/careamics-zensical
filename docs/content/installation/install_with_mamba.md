# Install with mamba

We recommend using [mamba (miniforge)](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download) 
to install all packages in a virtual environment. As an alternative, you can use
[conda 
(miniconda)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html)
with the same commands (replacing `mamba` by `conda`). 

This section install CAREamics for use in your own library or tool, via jupyter notebook
or as scripts. For the napari plugin, refer to the next section.

=== "Linux and Windows"
    1. Open the terminal and type `mamba` to verify that mamba is available.
    2. Create a new environment:
        
        ``` bash
        mamba create -n careamics python=3.12
        mamba activate careamics
        ```

    3. Install PyTorch following the [official 
        instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

        As an example, our test machine requires:

        ``` bash
        mamba install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
        ```
    
    4. Verify that the GPU is available:
        
        ``` bash
        python -c "import torch; print([torch.cuda.get_device_properties(i) for i in range(torch.cuda.device_count())])"
        ```

        This should show a list of available GPUs. If the list is empty, then you
        will need to change the `pytorch` and `pytorch-cuda` versions to match your
        hardware (linux and windows).
    
    5. Install CAREamics. We have several extra options (`examples`, `wandb`
        and `tensorboard`). If you wish to run the [example notebooks](https://github.com/CAREamics/careamics-examples),
        we recommend the following:

        ``` bash
        pip install "careamics[examples]"
        ```

    These instructions were tested on a linux virtual machine (RedHat 8.6) with a 
    NVIDIA A40-8Q GPU.

=== "macOS (no GPU)"
    1. Open the terminal and type `mamba` to verify that mamba is available.
    2. Create a new environment:
        
        ``` bash
        mamba create -n careamics python=3.12
        mamba activate careamics
        ```

    3. Install PyTorch following the [official 
        instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

        As an example, our test machine requires:

        ``` bash
        mamba install pytorch::pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
        ```

        !!! warning
            Note that this will probably not install silicon GPU acceleration. If
            you want GPU acceleration, please refer to the relevant section to ensure that
            you install packages for the correct platform.
    
    4. Install CAREamics. We have several extra options (`examples`, `wandb`
        and `tensorboard`). If you wish to run the [example notebooks](https://github.com/CAREamics/careamics-examples),
        we recommend the following:

        ``` bash
        pip install "careamics[examples]"
        ```


### Extra dependencies

CAREamics extra dependencies can be installed by specifying them in brackets. In the previous
section we installed `careamics[examples]`. You can add other extra dependencies, for instance
`wandb` by doing:

``` bash
pip install "careamics[examples, wandb]"
```

Here is a list of the extra dependencies:

- `examples`: Dependencies required to run the example notebooks.
- `wandb`: Dependencies to use [WandB](https://wandb.ai/site) as a logger.
- `tensorboard`: Dependencies to use [TensorBoard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tensorboard_with_pytorch.html) as a logger.

=== "mamba"
    1. Open the terminal and type `mamba` to verify that mamba is available.
    2. Create a new environment:
        
        ``` bash
        mamba create -n careamics python=3.12 --platform osx-arm64
        mamba activate careamics
        ```

    3. Install PyTorch following the [official 
        instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

        As an example, our test machine requires:

        ``` bash
        pip3 install torch torchvision
        ```
    
    4. Verify that GPU is available:
        ```bash
        python -c "import torch; import platform; print((platform.processor() in ('arm', 'arm64') and torch.backends.mps.is_available()))"
        ```

        If this prints `False`, make sure that you do have an M1, M2 or M3 chip, and that the `conda`/`mamba` macOS-arm64 release was installed correctly.

        python -c "import torch; import platform; print((platform.processor() in ('arm', 'arm64') and torch.backends.mps.is_available()))"
        ```
        
        If this prints `False`, make sure that you do have an M1, M2 or M3 chip, and that the `conda`/`mamba` macOS-arm64 release was installed correctly.
